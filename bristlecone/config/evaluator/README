Evaluatin Configuration README

This file contains standard configuration files used for Evaluator 
test runs.  You can run an evaluator test by following the steps
shown below: 

1. Add the JDBC driver for your database to the lib-ext directory. 

2. Edit one of the .xml configuration files.  Replace all variables 
surrounded by '@' signs with values of your choice. 

3. Run the evaluator.  

The Hypersonic example file does not require any configuration to be 
used, and the JDBC driver is already in the lib-ext directory.  You 
can therefore run Evaluator just by issuing the following command: 

  ../../bin/evaluator.sh -graph hsql_sample.xml
