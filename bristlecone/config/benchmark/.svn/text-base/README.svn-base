Benchmark Configuration README

This file contains standard property files used for benchmark tests.
Benchmark configuration files have "Scenario" in the property file
name.  Connection property files for different database types begin
with "connection_".

To get started, link one of the connection property files to the name
connection.properties.  Then you can run a benchmark.  Here are 
sample commands showing how to run a benchmark against Hypersonic. 

  ln -s connection_hsqldb.properties connection.properties
  benchmark.sh -csv out.csv -html out.html -props WriteSimpleScenario.properties

To test databases other than Hypersonic, you must put the JDBC driver
in the lib-ext directory.  Otherwise, the test will fail because it will
not find a suitable JDBC driver for the connection URL.  

Property files contain comments that explain the property settings.  See
also the user guide files in the doc directory.
