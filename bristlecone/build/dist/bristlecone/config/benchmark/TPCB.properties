# Properties for TPC-B test
#
# To invoke this test change the connection parameters and use the 
# following command. 
#   benchmark.sh -props TPCB.properties
#
# The TPC-B test follows standard TPC-B model with branches, tellers, and
# accounts.  The only difference is that the queryPct parameter sets the 
# percentage of read-only queries in the transaction mix. 

# Scenario name.

# Test monitor name for TPC-B stats while running.  Use this if you are
# not testing replication. 
#monitor=com.continuent.bristlecone.benchmark.tpcb.TPCBMonitor

# Test monitor for master/slave runs.  Use this to get stats on replication
# lag time and to make the test measure the time to get every transaction
# to the slave.

# Database connection information.  The monitorReplicaUrl is used by the 
# SlaveMonitor class.  It is the URL of the slave.
