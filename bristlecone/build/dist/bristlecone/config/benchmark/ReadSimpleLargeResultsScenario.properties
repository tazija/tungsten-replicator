# Describes a query benchmark that tests query performance using cross
# product selects.  Cross product selects generate result sets that are 
# N x N rows long where N is the number of rows in the table.  The 
# benchmarks use different values of fetch size parameters to control 
# the number of results pulled into memory at any given time during the 
# test. 
#
# To invoke this test try the following command. 
#   $bin/benchmark.sh -props config/benchmark/benchmark_query_long.properties
#
# This benchmark will quickly blow out Java heap if you go with the default 
# 64MB allocation.  You should increase heap size to at least 256MB for this
# benchmark.  Set environmental JVM_OPTIONS to -Xmx256M before running the 
# test.
